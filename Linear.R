# It is right to strongly believe an increase in TV advertisement budget will result to an increase in Sales

# Simple Linear Regression
# ________________________________________________________
# The simple linear regression is used to predict a quantitative outcome y(sales) on the basis of one single predictor variable x(TV).
# Assumption: There is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y .
# Find if there is a relationship between sales(Y) and TV(X):


# Fit a simple linear regression model, with sales as the response and Tv as the predictor.
lm.fit = lm(sales~TV)
lm.fit

# The equation is: sales ~ 7.03259 + 0.04754 TV

# Both the p-values ( Pr(r|t|) ) for the intercept and the predictor variable are highly significant,

# Confidence Interval for the model:
confint(lm.fit)
# That is, there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval [0.042, 0.053] will contain the true value of b1

# Assessing the Accuracy of the Model(This process is also referred to as the goodness-of-fit)
# How well does the model fit the data?
# Having established there being a significant relationship between TV advertisement budget and sales,
# determine the extent to which the model fits:


# 1. Residual Standard Error
cat("RSE: ",sigma(lm.fit), "\n")
#____________________________
# RSE is the residual variation
# RSE provides an absolute measure of patterns in the data that can't be explained by the model. The smaller the RSE, the better the model.
# Actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,259 units, on average.

# Prediction Error rate.
# Itâ€™s a measure of how well the model predicts the response variable.
# It is found by diving the RSE by the mean of sales: (RSE/mean(sales):
cat("PE:",sigma(lm.fit)/mean(sales), "\n") # 23% error rate


# 2. R-Squared
cat("R-squared: ",summary(lm.fit)$r.squared, "\n") # Equal to square of pearson coefficient[cor(sales, TV)^2]
#This tell us that 61.19% of variability in the response has been explained by the model.


# 3. F-statistic
# The F-statistic gives the overall significance of the model.
cat("F-statistic: \n", summary(lm.fit)$fstatistic, fill = 1)

# F-value = 312.145 with 1 degree of freedom, p-value 2.2e-16 which is highly significant.

# Pediction
lm.fit %>% predict(data.frame(TV =c(4))) # input a value of TV advertisement budget in the place of 4. I f multiple values then: c(a, b, c)
