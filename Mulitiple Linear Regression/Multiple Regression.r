# 1. Is there a relationship between advertising sales and budget?
# From the F-statistic test, p-value is <2.2e-16 indicating a clear evidence of a relationship between advetisement budgets and sales

# 2. How strong is the relationship?
#  Measures of Models of Accuracy:
#  a.RSE
  sigma(lm.fit1) #= 1.685551
# Mean sales = 14,022
# Percentage error indicated is 12% (1685/14,022)

#  b. R Squared
#  Approximately 90% of the variability in the data can be explained by the model
  
#  3. Which media contribute to sales?
#  Examine the p-values associated with each predictorÃ¢s t-statistic:
#  Apart from newspaper budget advertisement budget the other budgets are significantly related to sales.

#  4. How large is the effect of each medium on sales?
confint(lm.fit1)

# The confidence intervals for TV and radio are narrow and far from zero, providing evidence that these media are related to sales.
# But the interval for newspaper includes zero, indicating that the variable is not statistically significant given the values of TV and radio.

# 5. Is the relationship linear?
#  we saw that residual plots can be used in order to identify non-linearity.

# With this in mind, we can see, as expected, that there is less variability in the predicted values than the actual values..
