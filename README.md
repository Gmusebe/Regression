# Regression
Regression consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or multiple predictor variables (x).

From the **Advertisement Budget** data, our independent variables are TV, radio and newspaper advertisement budget data and our dependent factor is sales.

Linear regression is the most simple and popular technique for predicting a continuous variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables.

For the simple linear regression (using one independent variable to predict an outcome of another) the equation can be written as:
**y = b0 + b*x**, where:
  b0 is the intercept,
  b is the regression weight or coefficient associated with the predictor variable x.

The multiple linear regression equation, where a number of independent variables  are used to predict an outcome variable (y) is writte as:
**y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ...+ bn*xn**, where:
  b0 is the intercept,
  b1, b2, ..., bn is the regression weights or coefficients associated with the predictor variable x1, x2, ..., xn.
